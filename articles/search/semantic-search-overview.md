# Semantic search in Azure Cognitive Search

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Semantic search is in public preview under [supplemental terms of use](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/). It's available through the Azure portal, preview REST API, and beta SDKs. These features are billable (see [Availability and pricing](semantic-search-overview.md#availability-and-pricing)).

In Azure Cognitive Search, *semantic search* measurably improves search relevance by using language understanding to rerank search results. This article is a high-level introduction to semantic ranking. The [embedded video](#how-semantic-ranking-works) describes the technology, and the section at the end covers availability and pricing.

Semantic search is a premium feature that's billed by usage. We recommend this article for background, but if you'd rather get started, follow these steps:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * [Check regional availability](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=search).
> * [Enable semantic ranking](semantic-how-to-enable-disable.md) on your search service.
> * Create or modify queries to [return semantic captions and highlights](semantic-how-to-query-request.md).
> * Add a few more query properties to also [return semantic answers](semantic-answers.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Looking for vector support and similarity search? See [Vector search in Azure Cognitive Search](vector-search-overview.md) for details.

## What is semantic search?

Semantic search is a collection of query-related capabilities that improve the quality of an initial BM25-ranked search result for text-based queries. When you enable it on your search service, semantic search extends the query execution pipeline in two ways: 

* First, it adds secondary ranking over an initial result set that was scored using the BM25 algorithm, using language understanding models to promote the most semantically relevant results. 

* Second, it extracts and returns captions and answers in the response, which you can render on a search page to improve the user's search experience.

Here are the features of semantic search.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Semantic reranking | Uses the context or semantic meaning of a query to compute a new relevance score over existing BM25-ranked results. |
| [Semantic captions and highlights](semantic-how-to-query-request.md) | Extracts verbatim sentences and phrases from a document that best summarize the content, with highlights over key passages for easy scanning. Captions that summarize a result are useful when individual content fields are too dense for the search results page. Highlighted text elevates the most relevant terms and phrases so that users can quickly determine why a match was considered relevant. |
| [Semantic answers](semantic-answers.md) | An optional and extra substructure returned from a semantic query. It provides a direct answer to a query that looks like a question. It requires that a document has text with the characteristics of an answer. |

## How semantic ranking works

Semantic ranking looks for context and relatedness among terms, elevating matches that make more sense for the query. 

The following illustration explains the concept. Consider the term "capital". It has different meanings depending on whether the context is finance, law, geography, or grammar. Through language understanding, the semantic reranker can detect context and promote results that fit query intent.

Semantic ranking is both resource and time intensive. In order to complete processing within the expected latency of a query operation, inputs to the semantic ranker are consolidated and reduced so that the underlying summarization and reranking steps can be completed as quickly as possible.

### How inputs are prepared

In semantic ranking, the query subsystem passes search results as an input to the language understanding models. Because the models have input size constraints and are processing intensive, search results must be sized and structured for efficient handling.

1. Semantic ranking starts with a [BM25-ranked search result](index-ranking-similarity.md) from a text query. Only full text queries are in scope, and only the top 50 results progress to semantic ranking, even if results include more than 50.

1. From each match, for each field listed in the [semantic configuration](semantic-how-to-query-request.md#2---create-a-semantic-configuration), the query subsystem combines values into one long string. Typically, fields used in semantic ranking are textual and descriptive.

1. Excessively long strings are trimmed to ensure the overall length meets the input requirements of the summarization step.

   This trimming exercise is why it's important to add fields to your semantic configuration in priority order. If you have very large documents with text-heavy fields, anything after the maximum limit is ignored.

Each document is now represented by a single long string.

The string is composed of tokens, not characters or words. The maximum token count is 256 unique tokens. For estimation purposes, you can assume that 256 tokens are roughly equivalent to a string that is 256 words in length. 

> [!NOTE]
> Tokenization is determined in part by the [analyzer assignment](search-analyzers.md) on searchable fields. If you are using specialized analyzer, such as nGram or EdgeNGram, you might want to exclude that field from semantic ranking. For insights into how strings are tokenized, you can review the token output of an analyzer using the [Test Analyzer REST API](/rest/api/searchservice/test-analyzer).

### How inputs are summarized

After strings are prepared, it's now possible to pass the reduced inputs through machine reading comprehension and language representation models to determine which sentences and phrases provide the best summary, relative to the query. This phase extracts content from the string that will move forward to the semantic ranker.

Inputs to summarization are the long strings obtained for each document in the preparation phase. From each string, the summarization model finds a passage that is the most representative.

Outputs are:

* A [semantic caption](semantic-how-to-query-request.md) for the document. Each caption is available in a plain text version and a highlight version, and is frequently fewer than 200 words per document.

* An optional [semantic answer](semantic-answers.md), assuming you specified the `answers` parameter, the query was posed as a question, and a passage is found in the long string that provides a likely answer to the question.

Captions and answers are always verbatim text from your index. There's no generative AI model in this workflow that creates or composes new content.

### How summaries are scored

Scoring is done over captions.

1. Captions are evaluated for conceptual and semantic relevance, relative to the query provided.

1. A **@search.rerankerScore** is assigned to each document based on the semantic relevance of the caption. Scores range from 4 to 0 (high to low), where a higher score indicates a stronger match.

1. Matches are listed in descending order by score and included in the query response payload. The payload includes answers, plain text and highlighted captions, and any fields that you marked as retrievable or specified in a select clause.

> [!NOTE]
> Beginning on July 14, 2023, the **@search.rerankerScore** distribution is changing. The effect on scores can't be determined except through testing. If you have a hard threshold dependency on this response property, rerun your tests to understand what the new values should be for your threshold.

## Semantic capabilities and limitations

Semantic search is a newer technology so it's important to set expectations about what it can and can't do. What it can do:

* Promote matches that are semantically closer to the intent of original query.

* Find strings to use as captions and answers. Captions and answers are returned in the response and can be rendered on a search results page.

What semantic search can't do is rerun the query over the entire corpus to find semantically relevant results. Semantic search reranks the *existing* result set, consisting of the top 50 results as scored by the default ranking algorithm. Furthermore, semantic search can't create new information or strings. Captions and answers are extracted verbatim from your content so if the results don't include answer-like text, the language models won't produce one.

Although semantic search isn't beneficial in every scenario, certain content can benefit significantly from its capabilities. The language models in semantic search work best on searchable content that is information-rich and structured as prose. A knowledge base, online documentation, or documents that contain descriptive content see the most gains from semantic search capabilities.

The underlying technology is from Bing and Microsoft Research, and integrated into the Cognitive Search infrastructure as an add-on feature. For more information about the research and AI investments backing semantic search, see [How AI from Bing is powering Azure Cognitive Search (Microsoft Research Blog)](https://www.microsoft.com/research/blog/the-science-behind-semantic-search-how-ai-from-bing-is-powering-azure-cognitive-search/).

## Availability and pricing

Semantic search is available on search services at the Basic and higher tiers, subject to [regional availability](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=search).

When you enable semantic search, choose a pricing plan for the feature:

* At lower query volumes (under 1000 monthly), semantic search is free.
* At higher query volumes, choose the standard pricing plan.

The [Cognitive Search pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/) shows you the billing rate for different currencies and intervals.

Charges for semantic search are levied when query requests include `queryType=semantic` and the search string isn't empty (for example, `search=pet friendly hotels in New York`). If your search string is empty (`search=*`), you aren't charged, even if the queryType is set to semantic.

## Next steps

* [Enable semantic search](semantic-how-to-enable-disable.md) for your search service.
* [Configure semantic ranking](semantic-how-to-query-request.md) so that you can try out semantic search on your content.
