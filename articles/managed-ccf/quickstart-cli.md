# Quickstart: Create a Azure Managed CCF using Azure CLI

Microsoft Azure Managed Confidential Consortium Framework (Managed CCF) is a new and highly secure service for deploying confidential applications. For more information on Azure Managed CCF, and for examples use cases where Managed CCF is a good fit, see [About Microsoft Azure Managed Confidential Consortium Framework](overview.md).

Azure CLI is used to create and manage Azure resources using commands or scripts.

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

- This quickstart requires version 2.51.0 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.

## Create a resource group

## Create a member

## Create a Managed CCF resource

Use the Azure CLI [az confidentialledger managedccfs create](/cli/azure/confidentialledger/managedccfs#az-confidentialledger-managedccfs-create) command to create a Managed CCF resource in the resource group from the previous step. You will need to provide some information:

- Managed CCF name: A string of 3 to 32 characters that can contain only numbers (0-9), letters (a-z, A-Z), and hyphens (-)

  > [!Important]
  > Each Managed CCF resource must have a unique name. Replace \<your-unique-managed-ccf-name\> with the name of your resource in the following examples.

- Resource group name: **myResourceGroup**.
- Location: southcentralus or westeurope. Default value is southcentralus.
- Members: A collection of initial members to be added to the resource. A minimum of one member is required.
- Node count: Then number of nodes in the resource. Default value is 3.

```azurecli
az confidentialledger managedccfs create --name "<your-unique-managed-ccf-name>" --resource-group "myResourceGroup" --location "southcentralus" --members "[{certificate:'c:/certs/member0_cert.pem',identifier:'it-admin',group:'IT'},{certificate:'c:/certs/member1_cert.pem',identifier:'finance-admin',group:'Finance'}]"
```
To view the previously created resource:

```azurecli
az confidentialledger managedccfs show --name "<your-unique-managed-ccf-name>" --resource-group "myResourceGroup"
```

To list the Managed CCF resources in the **myResourceGroup**:

```azurecli
az confidentialledger managedccfs list --resource-group "myResourceGroup"
```
To list the Managed CCF resources in a subscription:

```azurecli
az confidentialledger managedccfs list --subscription <subscription id or subscription name>
```

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you created a Managed CCF resource by using the Azure portal. To learn more about Azure confidential ledger and how to integrate it with your applications, continue on to the articles below.
