# Quickstart: Deploy a JavaScript application to an Azure Managed CCF resource

In this quickstart tutorial, you will learn how to deploy an application to a Managed CCF resource. This tutorial builds on the Managed CCF resource created in the [Quickstart: Create an Azure Managed CCF resource](quickstart-portal.md) tutorial.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [Prerequisites](./includes/proposal-prerequisites.md)]

## Download the service identity

[!INCLUDE [Download Service Identity](./includes/service-identity.md)]

## Deploy the application

[!INCLUDE [Mac instructions](./includes/macos-instructions.md)]

> [!Note]
> This tutorial assumes that the JavaScript application bundle is created using the instructions available [here](https://microsoft.github.io/CCF/main/build_apps/js_app_bundle.html).

[!INCLUDE [Deploy an application](./includes/deploy-update-application.md)]

4. When the command completes, the application is deployed and ready to accept transactions.
