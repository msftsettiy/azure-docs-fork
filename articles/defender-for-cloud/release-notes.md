### Exempt functionality now available for Defender for APIs recommendations

September 11, 2023

You can now exempt recommendations for the following Defender for APIs security recommendations. 

| Recommendation | Description & related policy | Severity |
|--|--|--|
| (Preview) API endpoints that are unused should be disabled and removed from the Azure API Management service | As a security best practice, API endpoints that haven't received traffic for 30 days are considered unused, and should be removed from the Azure API Management service. Keeping unused API endpoints might pose a security risk. These might be APIs that should have been deprecated from the Azure API Management service, but have accidentally been left active. Such APIs typically do not receive the most up-to-date security coverage. | Low |
| (Preview) API endpoints in Azure API Management should be authenticated | API endpoints published within Azure API Management should enforce authentication to help minimize security risk. Authentication mechanisms are sometimes implemented incorrectly or are missing. This allows attackers to exploit implementation flaws and to access data. For APIs published in Azure API Management, this recommendation assesses the execution of authentication via the Subscription Keys, JWT, and Client Certificate configured within Azure API Management. If none of these authentication mechanisms are executed during the API call, the API will receive this recommendation. | High |

### Sensitive data discovery for PaaS databases (Preview)

September 5, 2023

Data-aware security posture capabilities for frictionless sensitive data discovery for PaaS Databases (Azure SQL Databases and Amazon RDS Instances of any type) are now in public preview. This public preview allows you to create a map of your critical data wherever it resides, and the type of data that is found in those databases.

Sensitive data discovery for Azure and AWS databases, adds to the shared taxonomy and configuration, which is already publicly available for cloud object storage resources (Azure Blob Storage, AWS S3 buckets and GCP storage buckets) and provides a single configuration and enablement experience.

Databases are scanned on a weekly basis. If you enable `sensitive data discovery`, discovery runs within 24 hours. The results can be viewed in the [Cloud Security Explorer](how-to-manage-cloud-security-explorer.md) or by reviewing the new [attack paths](how-to-manage-attack-path.md) for managed databases with sensitive data.

Data-aware security posture for databases is available through the [Defender CSPM plan](tutorial-enable-cspm-plan.md), and is automatically enabled on subscriptions where `sensitive data discovery` option is enabled.

You can learn more about data aware security posture in the following articles:

- [Support and prerequisites for data-aware security posture](concept-data-security-posture-prepare.md)

### Recommendation release: Microsoft Defender for Storage should be enabled with malware scanning and sensitive data threat detection

August 22, 2023

A new recommendation in Defender for Storage has been released. This recommendation ensures that Defender for Storage is enabled at the subscription level with malware scanning and sensitive data threat detection capabilities.

| Recommendation | Description  |
|--|--|
| Microsoft Defender for Storage should be enabled with malware scanning and sensitive data threat detection | Microsoft Defender for Storage detects potential threats to your storage accounts. It helps prevent the three major impacts on your data and workload: malicious file uploads, sensitive data exfiltration, and data corruption. The new Defender for Storage plan includes malware scanning and sensitive data threat detection. This plan also provides a predictable pricing structure (per storage account) for control over coverage and costs. With a simple agentless setup at scale, when enabled at the subscription level, all existing and newly created storage accounts under that subscription will be automatically protected. You can also exclude specific storage accounts from protected subscriptions.|

This new recommendation replaces the current recommendation `Microsoft Defender for Storage should be enabled` (assessment key 1be22853-8ed1-4005-9907-ddad64cb1417). However, this recommendation will still be available in Azure Government clouds.

Learn more about [Microsoft Defender for Storage](defender-for-storage-introduction.md).

### Extended properties in Defender for Cloud security alerts are masked from activity logs

August 17, 2023

We recently changed the way security alerts and activity logs are integrated. To better protect sensitive customer information, we no longer include this information in activity logs. Instead, we mask it with asterisks. However, this information is still available through the alerts API, continuous export, and the Defender for Cloud portal.

Customers who rely on activity logs to export alerts to their SIEM solutions should consider using a different solution, as it isn't the recommended method for exporting Defender for Cloud security alerts.

For instructions on how to export Defender for Cloud security alerts to SIEM, SOAR and other third party applications, see [Stream alerts to a SIEM, SOAR, or IT Service Management solution](export-to-siem.md).

### New security alerts in Defender for Servers Plan 2: Detecting potential attacks abusing Azure virtual machine extensions

August 7, 2023

This new series of alerts focuses on detecting suspicious activities of Azure virtual machine extensions and provides insights into attackers' attempts to compromise and perform malicious activities on your virtual machines.

Microsoft Defender for Servers can now detect suspicious activity of the virtual machine extensions, allowing you to get better coverage of the workloads security.  

Azure virtual machine extensions are small applications that run post-deployment on virtual machines and provide capabilities such as configuration, automation, monitoring, security, and more. While extensions are a powerful tool, they can be used by threat actors for various malicious intents, for example:

- Data collection and monitoring
- Code execution and configuration deployment with high privileges
- Resetting credentials and creating administrative users
- Encrypting disks

Here's a table of the new alerts.

|Alert (alert type)|Description|MITRE tactics|Severity|
|----|----|----|----|

The NIST 800-53 standards (both R4 and R5) have recently been updated with control changes in Microsoft Defender for Cloud regulatory compliance. The Microsoft-managed controls have been removed from the standard, and the information on the Microsoft responsibility implementation (as part of the cloud shared responsibility model) is now available only in the control details pane under **Microsoft Actions**.

These controls were previously calculated as passed controls, so you may see a significant dip in your compliance score for NIST standards between April 2023 and May 2023.

For more information on compliance controls, see [Tutorial: Regulatory compliance checks - Microsoft Defender for Cloud](regulatory-compliance-dashboard.md#investigate-regulatory-compliance-issues).

Now you can discover potential cost savings in security by applying Defender for Cloud within the context of an [Azure Migrate business case](/azure/migrate/concepts-business-case-calculation).

### Express configuration for vulnerability assessments in Defender for SQL is now Generally Available

June 7, 2023

Express configuration for vulnerability assessments in Defender for SQL is now Generally Available. Express configuration provides a streamlined onboarding experience for SQL vulnerability assessments by using a one-click configuration (or an API call). There's no extra settings or dependencies on managed storage accounts needed.

Check out this [blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-cloud/defender-for-sql-vulnerability-assessment-updates/ba-p/3837732) to learn more about express configuration.

You can learn the differences between [express and classic configuration](sql-azure-vulnerability-assessment-overview.md#what-are-the-express-and-classic-configurations).

### More scopes added to existing Azure DevOps Connectors

June 6, 2023

Defender for DevOps added the following extra scopes to the Azure DevOps (ADO) application:

- **Advance Security management**: `vso.advsec_manage`. Which is needed in order to allow you to enable, disable and manage GitHub Advanced Security for ADO.

- **Container Mapping**: `vso.extension_manage`, `vso.gallery_manager`; Which is needed in order to allow you to share the decorator extension with the ADO organization.  

Only new Defender for DevOps customers that are trying to onboard ADO resources to Microsoft Defender for Cloud are affected by this change.

### Onboarding directly (without Azure Arc) to Defender for Servers is now Generally Available

June 5, 2023

Previously, Azure Arc was required to onboard non-Azure servers to Defender for Servers. However, with the latest release you can also onboard your on-premises servers to Defender for Servers using only the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint agent.

This new method simplifies the onboarding process for customers focused on core endpoint protection and allows you to take advantage of Defender for Servers’ consumption-based billing for both cloud and noncloud assets. The direct onboarding option via Defender for Endpoint is available now, with billing for onboarded machines starting on July 1.

For more information, see [Connect your non-Azure machines to Microsoft Defender for Cloud with Defender for Endpoint](onboard-machines-with-defender-for-endpoint.md).

### Replacing agent-based discovery with agentless discovery for containers capabilities in Defender CSPM

June 4, 2023

With Agentless Container Posture capabilities available in Defender CSPM, the agent-based discovery capabilities are now retired. If you currently use container capabilities within Defender CSPM, please make sure that the [relevant extensions](how-to-enable-agentless-containers.md) are enabled to continue receiving container-related value of the new agentless capabilities such as container-related attack paths, insights, and inventory. (It can take up to 24 hours to see the effects of enabling the extensions).

### New alert in Defender for Key Vault

| Alert (alert type) | Description | MITRE tactics | Severity |
|---|---|:-:|---|
| **Unusual access to the key vault from a suspicious IP (Non-Microsoft or External)**<br>(KV_UnusualAccessSuspiciousIP) | A user or service principal has attempted anomalous access to key vaults from a non-Microsoft IP in the last 24 hours. This anomalous access pattern may be legitimate activity. It could be an indication of a possible attempt to gain access of the key vault and the secrets contained within it. We recommend further investigations. | Credential Access | Medium |

For all of the available alerts, see [Alerts for Azure Key Vault](alerts-reference.md#alerts-azurekv).

### Agentless scanning now supports encrypted disks in AWS

Agentless scanning for VMs now supports processing of instances with encrypted disks in AWS, using both CMK and PMK.

This extended support increases coverage and visibility over your cloud estate without impacting your running workloads. Support for encrypted disks maintains the same zero impact method on running instances.

- For new customers enabling agentless scanning in AWS - encrypted disks coverage is built in and supported by default.
- For existing customers that already have an AWS connector with agentless scanning enabled, you need to reapply the CloudFormation stack to your onboarded AWS accounts to update and add the new permissions that are required to process encrypted disks. The updated CloudFormation template includes new assignments that allow Defender for Cloud to process encrypted disks.

You can learn more about the [permissions used to scan AWS instances](faq-permissions.yml).

**To re-apply your CloudFormation stack**:

1. Go to Defender for Cloud environment settings and open your AWS connector.
1. Navigate to the **Configure Access** tab.
1. Select **Click to download the CloudFormation template**.
1. Navigate to your AWS environment and apply the updated template.

Learn more about [agentless scanning](concept-agentless-data-collection.md) and [enabling agentless scanning in AWS](enable-vulnerability-assessment-agentless.md#agentless-vulnerability-assessment-on-aws).

### Revised JIT (Just-In-Time) rule naming conventions in Defender for Cloud

We revised the JIT (Just-In-Time) rules to align with the Microsoft Defender for Cloud brand. We changed the naming conventions for Azure Firewall and NSG (Network Security Group) rules.

The changes are listed as follows:

| Description | Old Name |New Name  |
|---|---|---|
| JIT rule names (allow and deny) in NSG (Network Security Group) | SecurityCenter-JITRule | MicrosoftDefenderForCloud-JITRule
| JIT rule descriptions in NSG | ASC JIT Network Access rule | MDC JIT Network Access rule |
|JIT firewall rule collection names | ASC-JIT | MDC-JIT |
|JIT firewall rules names | ASC-JIT | MDC-JIT

Learn how to [secure your management ports with Just-In-Time access](just-in-time-access-usage.md).

### Onboard selected AWS regions

To help you manage your AWS CloudTrail costs and compliance needs, you can now select which AWS regions to scan when you add or edit a cloud connector.
You can now scan selected specific AWS regions or all available regions (default), when you onboard your AWS accounts to Defender for Cloud.
Learn more at [Connect your AWS account to Microsoft Defender for Cloud](quickstart-onboard-aws.md).

### Multiple changes to identity recommendations

The following recommendations are now released as General Availability (GA) and are replacing the V1 recommendations that are now deprecated.

#### General Availability (GA) release of identity recommendations V2

The V2 release of identity recommendations introduces the following enhancements:

- The scope of the scan has been expanded to include all Azure resources, not just subscriptions. Which enables security administrators to view role assignments per account.
- Specific accounts can now be exempted from evaluation. Accounts such as break glass or service accounts can be excluded by security administrators.
- The scan frequency has been increased from 24 hours to 12 hours, thereby ensuring that the identity recommendations are more up-to-date and accurate.

The following security recommendations are available in GA and replace the V1 recommendations:

We recommend updating your custom scripts, workflows, and governance rules to correspond with the V2 recommendations.

### Deprecation of legacy standards in compliance dashboard

Legacy PCI DSS v3.2.1 and legacy SOC TSP have been fully deprecated in the Defender for Cloud compliance dashboard, and replaced by [SOC 2  Type 2](/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-soc-2) initiative and [PCI DSS v4](/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-pci-dss) initiative-based compliance standards.
We have fully deprecated support of [PCI DSS](/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-pci-dss) standard/initiative in Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet.

Learn how to [customize the set of standards in your regulatory compliance dashboard](update-regulatory-compliance-packages.md).

### Two Defender for DevOps recommendations now include Azure DevOps scan findings

Defender for DevOps Code and IaC has expanded its recommendation coverage in Microsoft Defender for Cloud to include Azure DevOps security findings for the following two recommendations:

- `Code repositories should have code scanning findings resolved`

- `Code repositories should have infrastructure as code scanning findings resolved`

Previously, coverage for Azure DevOps security scanning only included the secrets recommendation.

Learn more about [Defender for DevOps](defender-for-devops-introduction.md).

### New default setting for Defender for Servers vulnerability assessment solution

Vulnerability assessment (VA) solutions are essential to safeguard machines from cyberattacks and data breaches.

Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management (MDVM) is now enabled as the default, built-in solution for all subscriptions protected by Defender for Servers that don't already have a VA solution selected.

If a subscription has a VA solution enabled on any of its VMs, no changes are made and MDVM won't be enabled by default on the remaining VMs in that subscription. You can choose to [enable a VA solution](deploy-vulnerability-assessment-defender-vulnerability-management.md) on the remaining VMs on your subscriptions.

Learn how to [Find vulnerabilities and collect software inventory with agentless scanning (Preview)](enable-vulnerability-assessment-agentless.md).

### Download a CSV report of your cloud security explorer query results (Preview)

Defender for Cloud has added the ability to download a CSV report of your cloud security explorer query results.

After your run a search for a query, you can select the **Download CSV report (Preview)** button from the Cloud Security Explorer page in Defender for Cloud.

### Release of containers Vulnerability Assessment powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management (MDVM) in Defender CSPM

We're announcing the release of Vulnerability Assessment for Linux images in Azure container registries powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management (MDVM) in Defender CSPM. This release includes daily scanning of images. Findings used in the Security Explorer and attack paths rely on MDVM Vulnerability Assessment instead of the Qualys scanner.  

The existing recommendation `Container registry images should have vulnerability findings resolved` is replaced by a new recommendation powered by MDVM:

|Recommendation | Description | Assessment Key|
|--|--|--|
| Container registry images should have vulnerability findings resolved (powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management)| Container image vulnerability assessment scans your registry for commonly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) and provides a detailed vulnerability report for each image. This recommendation provides visibility to vulnerable images currently running in your Kubernetes clusters. Remediating vulnerabilities in container images that are currently running is key to  improving your security posture, significantly reducing the attack surface for your containerized workloads. |dbd0cb49-b563-45e7-9724-889e799fa648 <br> is replaced by  c0b7cfc6-3172-465a-b378-53c7ff2cc0d5

Learn more about [Agentless Containers Posture in Defender CSPM](concept-agentless-containers.md).

Learn more about [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management (MDVM)](/microsoft-365/security/defender-vulnerability-management/defender-vulnerability-management).

### Renaming container recommendations powered by Qualys

The current container recommendations in Defender for Containers will be renamed as follows:

|Recommendation | Description | Assessment Key|
|--|--|--|
| Container registry images should have vulnerability findings resolved (powered by Qualys) | Container image vulnerability assessment scans your registry for security vulnerabilities and exposes detailed findings for each image. Resolving the vulnerabilities can greatly improve your containers' security posture and protect them from attacks. | dbd0cb49-b563-45e7-9724-889e799fa648 |
| Running container images should have vulnerability findings resolved (powered by Qualys) | Container image vulnerability assessment scans container images running on your Kubernetes clusters for security vulnerabilities and exposes detailed findings for each image. Resolving the vulnerabilities can greatly improve your containers' security posture and protect them from attacks. |  41503391-efa5-47ee-9282-4eff6131462c |

### Defender for DevOps GitHub Application update

Microsoft Defender for DevOps is constantly making changes and updates that require Defender for DevOps customers who have onboarded their GitHub environments in Defender for Cloud to provide permissions as part of the application deployed in their GitHub organization. These permissions are necessary to ensure all of the security features of Defender for DevOps operate normally and without issues.

We suggest updating the permissions as soon as possible to ensure continued access to all available features of Defender for DevOps.

Permissions can be granted in two different ways:

- In your organization, select **GitHub Apps**. Locate Your organization, and select **Review request**.

- You'll get an automated email from GitHub Support. In the email, select **Review permission request to accept or reject this change**.

After you have followed either of these options, you'll be navigated to the review screen where you should review the request. Select **Accept new permissions** to approve the request.

If you require any assistance updating permissions, you can [create an Azure support request](../azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request.md).

You can also learn more about [Defender for DevOps](defender-for-devops-introduction.md).
If a subscription has a VA solution enabled on any of its VMs, no changes are made and MDVM won't be enabled by default on the remaining VMs in that subscription. You can choose to [enable a VA solution](deploy-vulnerability-assessment-defender-vulnerability-management.md) on the remaining VMs on your subscriptions.

Learn how to [Find vulnerabilities and collect software inventory with agentless scanning (Preview)](enable-vulnerability-assessment-agentless.md).

### Defender for DevOps Pull Request annotations in Azure DevOps repositories now includes Infrastructure as Code misconfigurations

Defender for DevOps has expanded its Pull Request (PR) annotation coverage in Azure DevOps to include Infrastructure as Code (IaC) misconfigurations that are detected in Azure Resource Manager and Bicep templates.

Developers can now see annotations for IaC misconfigurations directly in their PRs. Developers can also remediate critical security issues before the infrastructure is provisioned into cloud workloads. To simplify remediation, developers are provided with a severity level, misconfiguration description, and remediation instructions within each annotation.

Previously, coverage for Defender for DevOps PR annotations in Azure DevOps only included secrets.

Learn more about [Defender for DevOps](defender-for-devops-introduction.md) and [Pull Request annotations](enable-pull-request-annotations.md).

- [Defender for APIs (Preview)](#defender-for-apis-preview)

### Agentless Container Posture in Defender CSPM (Preview)

The new Agentless Container Posture (Preview) capabilities are available as part of the Defender CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) plan.

Agentless Container Posture allows security teams to identify security risks in containers and Kubernetes realms. An agentless approach allows security teams to gain visibility into their Kubernetes and containers registries across SDLC and runtime, removing friction and footprint from the workloads.

Agentless Container Posture offers container vulnerability assessments that, combined with attack path analysis, enable security teams to prioritize and zoom into specific container vulnerabilities. You can also use cloud security explorer to uncover risks and hunt for container posture insights, such as discovery of applications running vulnerable images or exposed to the internet.

Learn more at [Agentless Container Posture (Preview)](concept-agentless-containers.md).

### Unified Disk Encryption recommendation (preview)

We have introduced a unified disk encryption recommendation in public preview, `Windows virtual machines should enable Azure Disk Encryption or EncryptionAtHost` and `Linux virtual machines should enable Azure Disk Encryption or EncryptionAtHost`.

These recommendations replace `Virtual machines should encrypt temp disks, caches, and data flows between Compute and Storage resources`, which detected Azure Disk Encryption and the policy `Virtual machines and virtual machine scale sets should have encryption at host enabled`, which detected EncryptionAtHost. ADE and EncryptionAtHost provide comparable encryption at rest coverage, and we recommend enabling one of them on every virtual machine. The new recommendations detect whether either ADE or EncryptionAtHost are enabled and only warn if neither are enabled. We also warn if ADE is enabled on some, but not all disks of a VM (this condition isn't applicable to EncryptionAtHost).

The new recommendations require [Azure Automanage Machine Configuration](https://aka.ms/gcpol).

These recommendations are based on the following policies:

- [(Preview) Windows virtual machines should enable Azure Disk Encryption or EncryptionAtHost](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f3dc5edcd-002d-444c-b216-e123bbfa37c0)
- [(Preview) Linux virtual machines should enable Azure Disk Encryption or EncryptionAtHost](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2fca88aadc-6e2b-416c-9de2-5a0f01d1693f)

Learn more about [ADE and EncryptionAtHost and how to enable one of them](../virtual-machines/disk-encryption-overview.md).

### Changes in the recommendation Machines should be configured securely

The recommendation `Machines should be configured securely` was updated. The update improves the performance and stability of the recommendation and aligns its experience with the generic behavior of Defender for Cloud's recommendations.

As part of this update, the recommendation's ID was changed from `181ac480-f7c4-544b-9865-11b8ffe87f47` to `c476dc48-8110-4139-91af-c8d940896b98`.

No action is required on the customer side, and there's no expected effect on the secure score.

### Deprecation of App Service language monitoring policies

The following App Service language monitoring policies have been deprecated due to their ability to generate false negatives and because they don't provide better security. You should always ensure you're using a language version without any known vulnerabilities.

| Policy name | Policy ID |
|--|--|
| [App Service apps that use Java should use the latest 'Java version'](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F496223c3-ad65-4ecd-878a-bae78737e9ed) | 496223c3-ad65-4ecd-878a-bae78737e9ed |
| [App Service apps that use Python should use the latest 'Python version'](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F7008174a-fd10-4ef0-817e-fc820a951d73) | 7008174a-fd10-4ef0-817e-fc820a951d73 |
| [Function apps that use Java should use the latest 'Java version'](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F9d0b6ea4-93e2-4578-bf2f-6bb17d22b4bc) | 9d0b6ea4-93e2-4578-bf2f-6bb17d22b4bc |
| [Function apps that use Python should use the latest 'Python version'](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F7238174a-fd10-4ef0-817e-fc820a951d73) | 7238174a-fd10-4ef0-817e-fc820a951d73 |

Customers can use alternative built-in policies to monitor any specified language version for their App Services.

These policies are no longer available in Defender for Cloud's built-in recommendations. You can [add them as custom recommendations](create-custom-recommendations.md) to have Defender for Cloud monitor them.

### New alert in Defender for Resource Manager

Defender for Resource Manager has the following new alert:

| Alert (alert type) | Description | MITRE tactics | Severity |
|---|---|:-:|---|
| **PREVIEW - Suspicious creation of compute resources detected**<br>(ARM_SuspiciousComputeCreation) | Microsoft Defender for Resource Manager identified a suspicious creation of compute resources in your subscription utilizing Virtual Machines/Azure Scale Set. The identified operations are designed to allow administrators to efficiently manage their environments by deploying new resources when needed. While this activity may be legitimate, a threat actor might utilize such operations to conduct crypto mining.<br> The activity is deemed suspicious as the compute resources scale is higher than previously observed in the subscription. <br> This can indicate that the principal is compromised and is being used with malicious intent. | Impact | Medium  |

You can see a list of all of the [alerts available for Resource Manager](alerts-reference.md#alerts-resourcemanager).

### Three alerts in the Defender for Resource Manager plan have been deprecated

The following three alerts for the Defender for Resource Manager plan have been deprecated:

- `Activity from a risky IP address (ARM.MCAS_ActivityFromAnonymousIPAddresses)`
- `Activity from infrequent country (ARM.MCAS_ActivityFromInfrequentCountry)`
- `Impossible travel activity (ARM.MCAS_ImpossibleTravelActivity)`

In a scenario where activity from a suspicious IP address is detected, one of the following Defenders for Resource Manager plan alerts `Azure Resource Manager operation from suspicious IP address` or `Azure Resource Manager operation from suspicious proxy IP address` will be present.

### Alerts automatic export to Log Analytics workspace have been deprecated

Defenders for Cloud security alerts are automatically exported to a default Log Analytics workspace on the resource level. This causes an indeterministic behavior and therefore we have deprecated this feature.

Instead, you can export your security alerts to a dedicated Log Analytics workspace with [Continuous Export](continuous-export.md#set-up-a-continuous-export).

If you have already configured continuous export of your alerts to a Log Analytics workspace, no further action is required.

### Deprecation and improvement of selected alerts for Windows and Linux Servers

The security alert quality improvement process for Defender for Servers includes the deprecation of some alerts for both Windows and Linux servers. The deprecated alerts are now sourced from and covered by Defender for Endpoint threat alerts.  

If you already have the Defender for Endpoint integration enabled, no further action is required. You may experience a decrease in your alerts volume in April 2023.

If you don't have the Defender for Endpoint integration enabled in Defender for Servers, you'll need to enable the Defender for Endpoint integration to maintain and improve your alert coverage.

All Defender for Servers customers, have full access to the Defender for Endpoint’s integration as a part of the [Defender for Servers plan](plan-defender-for-servers-select-plan.md#plan-features).  

You can learn more about [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint onboarding options](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md#enable-the-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-integration).

You can also view the [full list of alerts](alerts-reference.md#deprecated-defender-for-servers-alerts) that are set to be deprecated.

### Two recommendations related to missing Operating System (OS) updates were released to GA

The recommendations `System updates should be installed on your machines (powered by Azure Update Manager)` and `Machines should be configured to periodically check for missing system updates` have been released for General Availability.

To use the new recommendation, you need to:

- Connect your non-Azure machines to Arc.
- [Enable the periodic assessment property](../update-center/assessment-options.md#periodic-assessment). You can use the [Fix button](implement-security-recommendations.md).
 in the new recommendation, `Machines should be configured to periodically check for missing system updates` to fix the recommendation.

After completing these steps, you can remove the old recommendation `System updates should be installed on your machines`, by disabling it from Defender for Cloud's built-in initiative in Azure policy.

will both be available until the [Log Analytics agent is deprecated on August 31, 2024](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/were-retiring-the-log-analytics-agent-in-azure-monitor-on-31-august-2024/), which is when the older version (`System updates should be installed on your machines`) of the recommendation will be deprecated as well. Both recommendations return the same results and are available under the same control `Apply system updates`.

The new recommendation `System updates should be installed on your machines (powered by Azure Update Manager)`, has a remediation flow available through the Fix button, which can be used to remediate any results through the Update Manager (Preview). This remediation process is still in Preview.

The new recommendation `System updates should be installed on your machines (powered by Azure Update Manager)`, isn't expected to affect your Secure Score, as it has the same results as the old recommendation `System updates should be installed on your machines`.

The prerequisite recommendation ([Enable the periodic assessment property](../update-center/assessment-options.md#periodic-assessment)) has a negative effect on your Secure Score. You can remediate the negative effect with the available [Fix button](implement-security-recommendations.md).
