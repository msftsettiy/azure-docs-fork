# Bulk download members of a group in Azure Active Directory

You can bulk download the members of a group in your organization to a comma-separated values (CSV) file from the Microsoft Entra Admin center. All admins and non-admin users can download group membership lists.

## To bulk download group membership

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Global Administrator](../roles/permissions-reference.md#global-administrator).
1. Select Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD).
1. Select **Groups** > **All groups**.
1. Open the group whose membership you want to download, and then select **Members**.
1. On the **Members** page, select **Bulk operations** and choose, **Download members** to download a CSV file listing the group members.

   ![The Download Members command is on the profile page for the group](./media/groups-bulk-download-members/download-panel.png)

## Check download status

You can see the status of all of your pending bulk requests in the **Bulk operation results** page.
